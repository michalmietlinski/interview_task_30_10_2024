## Introduction

Application should contain list of **bank transactions**, based on design structure from _design.png_ file and contain following functionalities:

1.  Transactions fetched from API, displayed in table or list.
2.  Pagination (infinite-scroll or traditional with 20 items per page)
3.  Filtering by `beneficiary` field
4.  Form for adding new transaction to the list with basic non-empty fields validation. Add input fields for:
    - amount (must be positive)
    - account number (not empty, numbers)
    - address
    - description
    - date and id should be generated when submiting form
5.  Simple communicate when success/error after form submission.
6.  Removing transaction from the list (animation will be apreciated)
7.  Balance should be calculated based on already filtered transactions.

NOTE: Points 2-6 can be done on front-end side only.
